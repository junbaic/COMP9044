Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa  You know you love me, you know you care  
Just shout whenever and I'll be there  
You are my love, you are my heart  
And we will never, ever, ever be apart  
  
Are we an item? Girl quit playin'  
We're just friends, what are you sayin'  
Said there's another, look right in my eyes  
My first love, broke my heart for the first time  
  
And I was like baby, baby, baby oh  
Like baby, baby, baby no  
Like baby, baby, baby oh  
I thought you'd always be mine (Mine)  
Baby, baby, baby oh  
Like baby, baby, baby no  
Like baby, baby, baby ooh  
I thought you'd always be mine  
  
Oh for you, I would have done whatever  
And I just can't believe we ain't together  
And I wanna play it cool  
But I'm losin' you  
I'll buy you anything  
I'll buy you any ring  
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me  
And just shake me, til you wake me from this bad dream  
I'm goin' down, down, down, down  
And I can't believe my first love won't be around
