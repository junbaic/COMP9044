The birds they sang  At the break of day  
Start again  
I heard them say  
Don't dwell on what  
Has passed away  
Or what is yet to be.  
Ah the wars they will  
Be fought again  
The holy dove  
She will be caught again  
Bought and sold  
And bought again  
The dove is never free.  
  
Ring the bells that still can ring  
Forget your perfect offering  
There is a crack in everything  
That's how the light gets in.
