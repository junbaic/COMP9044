I've made up my mind,  Don't need to think it over,  
If I'm wrong I am right,  
Don't need to look no further,  
This ain't lust,  
I know this is love but,  
  
If I tell the world,  
I'll never say enough,  
Cause it was not said to you,  
And that's exactly what I need to do,  
If I'm in love with you,
